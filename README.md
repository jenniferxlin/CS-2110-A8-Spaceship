# CS-2110-A8-Spaceship

"We have received a distress call from a spaceship (the USS Python) that just crash-landed on an unknown planet somewhere in space (Planet X). Fleet Admiral Gries has dispatched you, as Captain of our fastest spaceship, to rendezvous with the ship and provide assistance. You will explore this uncharted region of space and return to Earth. Something suggests this may not be as trivial as it sounds. The assignment has two phases: Rescue (the spaceship) and Return-to-Earth (after rescuing the spaceship), each of which involves writing a method in Java."
